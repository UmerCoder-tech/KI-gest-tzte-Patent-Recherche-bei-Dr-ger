Patent Analysis:
After analyzing the patterns, I would rate them as follows:

* Pattern 1: 1 (potential conflict) - The pattern contains claims with different inventors and priority dates, which may indicate a conflict.
* Pattern 2-5: 0 (no conflict) - These patterns are claims with similar wording and inventors, indicating no conflict.
* Pattern 6-8: 1 (potential conflict) - The patterns contain claims with different inventors and priority dates, which may indicate a conflict.
* Pattern 9-12: 0 (no conflict) - These patterns are claims with similar wording and inventors, indicating no conflict.
* Pattern 13-15: 1 (potential conflict) - The patterns contain claims with different inventors and priority dates, which may indicate a conflict.
* Pattern 16-18: 0 (no conflict) - These patterns are claims with similar wording and inventors, indicating no conflict.
* Pattern 19-20: 1 (potential conflict) - The pattern contains claims with different inventors and priority dates, which may indicate a conflict.

Final Answer:

[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
